# Leaf_Traits
Author: Emma Tung Corcoran

## Introduction
This document covers my workflow for processing leaf morphology trait data collected by [ARADEEPOPSIS](https://github.com/Gregor-Mendel-Institute/aradeepopsis). After running ARADEEPOPSIS, a software tool utilizing a convolutional neural network, to analyze plant growth, biomass accumulation and senescence from rosette image data, a csv file containing 78 morphometric and color-related traits is generated. This workflow utilizes dimensionality reduction and clustering methods to further analyze these trait data.
